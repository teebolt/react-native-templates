# iOS Templates for React Native

Templates for starting a React Native iOS project. These are the same that you would find when creating a new project in Xcode (minus the game templates).

Really simple and easy to use if you are familiar with using the Xcode iOS templates

## Template List
* Master-Detail Application
* Page-Based Application
* Single View Application (Effectively React Native Default)
* Tabbed Application

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. npm install
3. Launch the xcode project for the particular template

## Contributing

Would like to add support for Android and make these generic templates cross-platform
